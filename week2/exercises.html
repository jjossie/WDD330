        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <h3>Chapter 4</h3>
        <p>
            Does the <code>args</code> variable inside a function contain all arguments passed, or just those 
            beyond the named arguments? Is that different when using the spread operator? So like: <br>
            <code class="block">function myFunc(a, b, ...args){<br>
                &nbsp;return args<br>}</code>
            <br>
            If we call it like <br>
            <code>myFunc("A", "B", "C", "D");</code> <br>
            does it return <code>["A", "B", "C", "D"]</code> or just <code>["C", "D"]</code>?
        </p>
        <p>
            When using function expressions, are there any constraints to using a <code>const</code> to store a function
            versus a <code>var</code>? Like in C++ a <code>const</code> function cannot mutate anyone's state (or 
            at least the state of the object to which it belongs). Does Javascript do something similar, or is 
            <code>const</code> only an indicator that the variable cannot later be reassigned a different function/value?
        </p>
        <p>
            Is there a sort function that doesn't require a callback to correctly sort numbers? It seems totally
            unnecessary to by default treat all array items as strings in a sort() function to me. If not,
            is there a built-in callback for numeric sorting perhaps?
        </p>
